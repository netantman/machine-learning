# Problem Formulation/Definition

- What is the core business problem/dependent variable we are trying to model: determine potentially which ML models we need.
    - 'Predicting stock returns': regreesion; 'Predicting stock price change directions': classification. 
- What are the performance metrics to satisfy business goals?
    - What value is added for the business?
    - If a wrong prediction is made, how does it impact the business?
- [Scope](scoping.ipynb) of the project. 
    - How good does it need to be so as to considered a success?
    - Are there benchmarks? Human-level performance?
    - Are there reasons (economically or common-sense) that the data has informative information about the dependent variable?
- System Limitations
    - What is the budget?
    - What is the latency needed?
    - At what frequencies do you need the predictions, and what is the total number of predictions throughout the day?
    - Where is the model deployed?
- Other considerations
    - Is ML even needed? Can we use a simple heurestics or rules?
    - Are there legal or regulatory risks associated with the project?
