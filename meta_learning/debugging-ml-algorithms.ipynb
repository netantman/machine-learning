    "In a famous 1996 paper, David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the **No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem**. \n",
    "- For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better (hence the name of the theorem). The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. \n",
    "- Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and evaluate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks."

    "In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele Banko and Eric Brill showed that very different Machine Learning algorithms, including fairly simple ones, performed almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation8 once they were given enough data. \n",

    "The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”, published in 2009. It should be noted, however, that small- and medium-sized datasets are still very common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra training data⁠—so don’t abandon algorithms just yet."
