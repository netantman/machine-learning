    "With its `memory` parameter set, `Pipeline` will cache each transformer after calling `fit`. This feature is used to avoid computing the fit transformers within a pipeline if the parameters and input data are identical. A typical example is the case of a grid search in which the transformers can be fitted only once and reused for each configuration. But a side effect is that with caching enabled, it may become impossible to inspect the original instance."

Processing your data before passing it to `sklearn` might be problematic for one of the following reasons:\n",
