    "The difference between a CNN and a regular MLP is that CNN has sub network of neurons that serve as **filter** with small **reception fields** that scan the initial input, identifying basic patterns. Subsequent layers in CNN then combine the basic patterns and recognize more complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolutional layers: layers with the sub network, or neurons with shared weights, that scans with **stride**. First level neurons scan the input, while higher-level neurons scan the 'maps' formed by lower-level neurons.\n",
    "- Max, or max pooling layers: after each conv layer, it can be optionally followed by a 'max' or any other 'pooling' operation to collect information across the map."

    "- The scanning block of convelutional layers can be distributed over multiple layers of the network, resulting in significant reduction in the total number of parameters.\n",
    "- CNN is suited to serve as 'position-invariant' classifier, such as 'is there a cat somewhere in the picture' or 'is the word welcome in this speech'? That is something that fully-connected MLP cannot do."
