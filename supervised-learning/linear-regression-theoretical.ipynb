    "### Gauss-Markov Theorm\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumptions A1, A4 and A5 (notably, A6, or Gaussian of errors is not required). Then the OLS estimator is the **Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE)**. That is, let $\\tilde{\\beta}$ be a linear conditionally unbiased estimator of $\\beta$, i.e. $E(\\tilde{\\beta}|X)=E(\\hat{\\beta}|X)=\\beta$, and $\\tilde\\beta=A\\beta$ for some matrix $A$. Then **$var(\\tilde{\\beta}|X)- E(\\hat{\\beta}|X)$ is a positive-definite matrix**, where it is a zero-matrix only when $\\tilde{\\beta}=\\hat{\\beta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Markov theorem implies that the **least squares estimator has the smallest mean squared error of all linear estimators with no bias**. However, there may well exist a biased estimator with smaller mean squared error. Such an estimator would trade a little bias for a larger reduction in variance. And this is the intuition of shrinkage methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large- and Small-sample properties of the OLS estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumptions A1-A4 above, \n",
    "- OLS estimator is **consistent**, meaning in large sample, $\\hat{\\beta}$ tends to the true $\\beta$ value with probability one. \n",
    "- OLS estimator is **asympototic normal**.\n",
    "In particular, consistency and asymptotic normality does not need homogeneity of regression errors or conditional normality of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the **additional assumption of A6**: $\\epsilon\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I)$, the OLS estimators are normal even in small samples: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\beta}\\sim N(\\beta, (X^{T}X)^{-1}\\sigma^2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is to note that while it is trivial that $\\hat{\\beta}$ is normal, and it suffices to deduce its mean and variance from the expression of $\\hat{\\beta}$ and the model on $y$: $y=X\\beta+\\epsilon$. \n",
